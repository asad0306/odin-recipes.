    <h2>Butter Chicken Recipe</h2>
    <p>Butter chicken or murgh makhani is a curry of chicken in a spiced tomato, butter and cream sauce.<br>
        It originated in the Indian subcontinent as a curry. 
        It is similar to chicken tikka masala, which uses a tomato paste.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>6 tablespoons butter, divided</li>
            <li>2 lbs boneless/skinless chicken thighs, cut into 1” chunks</li>
            <li>1 yellow onion, diced</li>
            <li>3 garlic cloves, minced</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp garam masala</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp fresh grated ginger</li>
            <li>1 tsp chili powder</li>
            <li>1 tsp ground cumin</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups tomato sauce**** (or one 14 oz can would work)</li>
            <li>2 cups cream*</li>
            <li>salt & pepper</li>
            <li>lime & cilantro, for garnish</li>
            <li>naan & rice for serving</li>    
        </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
     <ol>
         <li>Using 2 Tbsp of butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat, brown the pieces of the chicken so each side is browned.<br>
             They do not need to be fully cooked all the way through. Work in batches, and set aside when you’re done.</li>
             <li>Melt another 2 Tbsp of butter in the pan over medium heat. Add the onion, and cook until beginning to soften — about three minutes.<br>Add the garlic, garam masala, ginger, chili powder, cumin, and cayenne. 
                 Stir to combine, and cook for about 45 seconds before adding the tomato sauce.</li>
                 <li>Bring the mixture to a simmer and let cook for five minutes before adding the cream. Bring the mixture back to a simmer, add the browned chicken, and let simmer for 10-15 minutes.<br> 
                     Keep the heat low here — not a rolling boil.</li>
                     <li>Stir in the remaining 2 Tbsp of butter, and season with salt and pepper, to taste.</li>
                     <li>Serve garnished with lime and cilantro, alongside rice and naan.</li>
                     <li>Enjoy!</li>
